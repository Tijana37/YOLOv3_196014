# YOLOv3_196014
Subject: Digital Image Processing @FINKI
Project: Object detection algorithms based on neural networks - YOLO version 3

@Official_DPNS_project.pdf is the project with no explanation of the code but provides good base of convolutional neural networks.
The code is taken from (https://github.com/ayooshkathuria/YOLO_v3_tutorial_from_scratch).
Tutorials from (https://blog.paperspace.com/how-to-implement-a-yolo-object-detector-in-pytorch/).

Missing file with weights for the CNN because it's too large to update it. Download it from the tutorials site, page 3.
